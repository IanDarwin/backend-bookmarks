== Bookmarks REST via quarkus and Java EE

This project displays Ian's saved web bookmarks, for use by the bookmarks.flutter application
among others.

This project uses Quarkus, "the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework."

Prerequisites:
	You need a modern Java installed and on your PATH, and Apache Maven installed and on PATH.

Startup: 

# In src/main/resources, copy the file `application-resources.properties.sample` to `application-resources.properties`
# Run `mvn quarkus:dev`

To use a real database, make the obvious changes in two files, `application-resources.properties` and `src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml`

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, most of the original README is in README.quarkus.md
